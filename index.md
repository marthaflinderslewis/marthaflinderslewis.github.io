## Research Interests
I use interdisciplinary approaches to modelling language and concepts. My research splits into three broad areas - compositional approaches to language and meaning, applications of quantum theory in modelling language, and evolutionary approaches to language.

#### Compositional approaches
Humans are able to generate and to understand completely novel combinations of concepts. How can we do this? I look at ways to integrate symbolic composition with statistical or fuzzy representations of concepts. I look at [integrating grammar with conceptual spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.08314), a [hierarchical approach to concept composition](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0004370216300492), and [logical structure in vector spaces](http://jcs.snu.ac.kr/jcs/index.php/issues/?uid=330&mod=document)

I have also recently started working on [metaphor](https://aclanthology.org/2021.naacl-main.372/) and my student Xiaoyu Tong developed a comprehensive [metaphor paraphrase dataset](https://github.com/xiaoyuisrain/metaphor-paraphrase-dataset) which we are currently extending.


#### Applications of quantum theory
There is a wide range of work that examines quantum approaches in cognitive science. I provide a thorough [review](https://psyarxiv.com/hvbgt/) of this research.The compositional framework I work in has its roots in quantum theory. Density matrices are a notion taken from quantum theory that I have used to model [hyponymy](https://jlm.ipipan.waw.pl/index.php/JLM/article/view/230) and [entailment](https://aclanthology.org/R19-1075/) within a compositional vector-based model of meaning. The same framework is used to model [lexical ambiguity](https://aclanthology.org/2020.conll-1.21/) where we show how to learn density matrix representations of words from a corpus and how these representations disambiguate in the process of composition.

#### Evolutionary approaches
A key aspect of human concept use is that concepts and word use evolve over time. I have examined how shared concepts can emerge in a community of artificial agents, and the impact of [linguistic hedges](https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.06755) and [concept conjunction](https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.06738) on the resulting concepts.

Work in progress: integrating the compositional vector-based model of meaning with an evolutionary model..... watch this space!

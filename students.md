## Current Students:
- [Carys Harvey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carysharvey/) (PhD, co-supervised with Bob Coecke). Carys is working on implementing NLP algorithms on quantum hardware.
- [Xiaoyu Tong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xiaoyu-tong-7a280b1a9/) (PhD, co-supervised with Ekaterina Shutova). Xiaoyu's research looks at metaphor interpretation via paraphrase and inference.
- [Junda Liu](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/junda-liu) (PhD, co-supervised with Nirav Ajmeri). Junda's research is in ethics in multi-agent systems, specifically driverless vehicles.
- Changshuo Wang (MSc Engineering Maths) Changshuo's research is in extending neural methods for building density matrices.
- Qiming Chen (MSc Engineering Maths) Qiming looks at modelling generic sentences with density matrices.
- [Mike Nelhams](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-nelhams-91a077167/) (MEng Engineering Maths). Mike is looking at using density matrices on larger-scale entailment datasets.
- Ben Lippold (MEng Engineering Maths). Ben is investigating the interaction of metaphor and natural language inference.

**Prospective Students:** If you are interested in working with me, please do get in touch. Funding for PhD students is available via the [Interactive AI CDT](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/cdt/interactive-ai/) and the [Quantum Engineering CDT](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/quantum-engineering/) - funding is mostly for UK students, but a portion is reserved for international students. I am also available to supervise MSc projects and welcome contact from students interested in designing their own project.

## Past Students
- [James Owers](https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-owers-59653b205/) (MSc Data Science, Bristol, 2021). James investigated the ability of density matrices and state of the art sentence encoders to accurately select the correct paraphrase from a novel metaphor paraphrase dataset. Spoiler alert - none of the models were any good!
- [Shuhao Zhang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shuhao-zhang-1723121b4/) (MSc Data Science, Bristol,  2021). Shuhao looked at novel approaches to building word region embeddings.
- [Jiaqi Wu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jiaqi-wu-7aa5021b8/) (MSc Data Science, Bristol, 2021). Jiaqi investigated the performance of neural density matrices to encode hyponymy.
- [Xiaoyu Tong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xiaoyu-tong-7a280b1a9/) (MSc Brain and Cognitive Sciences, UvA, 2020, co-supervised with Ekaterina Shutova). Xiaoyu built a large natural language [metaphor paraphrase dataset](https://github.com/xiaoyuisrain/metaphor-paraphrase-dataset) and undertook a systematic review of [neural methods for metaphor processing in NLP](https://aclanthology.org/2021.naacl-main.372/).
- [Francois Meyer](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Francois-Meyer-6) (MSc AI, UvA, 2020). Francois built a [neural model for generating density matrix word embeddings](https://aclanthology.org/2020.conll-1.21/), showing how these embeddings can represent multiple senses of words which are disambiguated in the process of composition.
- [Verna Dankers](https://www.vernadankers.com/) (MSc AI, UvA, 2019, co-supervised with Ekaterina Shutova). Verna developed a multitask learning architecture to [jointly detect metaphor and emotion](https://aclanthology.org/D19-1227/), as well as a heap of other stuff!
- [Yaared al-Mehairi](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/yaared.al-mehairi/) (MFoCS, Oxford, 2016, co-supervised with Bob Coecke). Yaared worked on linking the [DisCoCat model](https://arxiv.org/abs/1003.4394) with Smolensky's Integrated Connectionist-Symbolic model, resulting in a [paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-52289-0_10) at QI2016
- Dea Bankova (MFoCS, Oxford, 2015, co-supervised with Bob Coecke). Dea worked on the use of [density matrix models for hyponymy and entailment](https://jlm.ipipan.waw.pl/index.php/JLM/article/view/230)
